<h1>
Final Project Scenario
</h1>
<h4>
Estimated duration: 6 minutes
</h4>
<h2 id="scenario-new-hire-orientation-program">Scenario: New Hire
Orientation program</h2>
Innovations Inc. is a company that features office interior decorating
and renovation solutions. The organization has been in business for more
than 20 years, with an annual sales exceeding $12M. The organization
have over 300 employees in the three-state area of the United States of
America.
</p>
Recently, Innovations Inc. is seeing an increase in employee attrition
when compared with the past years. During the exit surveys, a primary
complaint from employees has been the lack of an effective orientation
program and lack of corporate support.
</p>
After analysis, the Innovations Inc. HR has found that approximately 4%
of new employees quit within their first week of employment, and
approximately 20% left within 45 days of hire. The statistics map to the
trends seen across the industry. This supported recent industry reports
that stated 4% of all employees leave the job on the first day, and 22%
leave within 45 days. Sadly, Innovations Inc. spends at least $6000 to
recruit a new employee.
</p>
In an attempt to reduce attrition rates, the HR team at Innovations
Inc. is initiating a project to develop a New Hire Orientation program.
Marcus Wilson, the Head of HR at Innovations Inc., will sponsor the
project. He will devote two hours per week to the project. Gloria Fisher
is the newly assigned project manager. She will devote 20 hours a week
to the project. Marcus wants the costs to be reasonable. However, if
needed, the senior management at Innovations Inc. is ready to invest
what it takes to make the program a success. The team has about 14 weeks
before the first orientation event to develop the New Hire Orientation
program.
</p>
The New Hire Orientation program will be run quarterly. The first formal
orientation is scheduled for 1-2 June. It is currently 15 February.
Project initiation must begin immediately to complete the development on
time and be ready for the 1 June kick-off. The June date is firm and
cannot be adjusted. All follow-up activities must be completed by 20
June.
</p>
Marcus estimates that approximately 12 new employees will participate in
the New Hire Orientation program each quarter. An additional 8
individuals from Innovations Inc. will participate fully. The project
will be funded for program development and all direct costs associated
with the 1 June inaugural event. After that, the New Hire Orientation
program will be funded through HR operations.
</p>
This project includes planning and developing the program and
implementing the initial orientation.
