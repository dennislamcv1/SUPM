<h1>
Final Project Scenario
</h1>
<h4>
Estimated duration: 8.6 minutes
</h4>
<h2 id="scenario-two-day-seminar-and-workshop">Scenario: Two-Day Seminar
and Workshop</h2>
<p>Project Scenario Success Inc. is an investment company with offices
throughout the United States and Canada. Their primary goal is to
provide personalized asset management and investment guidance to
individuals with portfolios exceeding US $250,000. Success hosts a
twice-yearly two-day seminar and workshop for potential investors. Day 1
of the seminar is for Success Inc. executive employees. This initial day
is for sharing information, providing an environment for the team to
network, and preparing for day 2. Day 2 is for all potential investors.
Investors can attend in person. Success Inc. will stream presentations
for those who cannot attend. Success Inc. will host its fall event in
Dallas, Texas, on March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Juan Cortez is the Project Manager. The Sponsor for the project is
his manager, Sandra Morgan. They are both assigned to the Success
Inc. Operations branch. The final project plan includes the following
requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The event location is the Gateway Hotel and Convention Center in Dallas.
Success Inc. distributed invitations to approximately 350 clients to
attend. Success Inc. invited another 200 potential clients to
participate in the virtual option. The event anticipates parking costs
for approximately 175 vehicles.
</li>
</p>
<li>
Comprehensive investment packets defining the service offerings and gift
packets must be assembled and distributed to all attendees. Those
attending in person will receive their packets at the event at check-in.
Those people virtually attending must receive their packets via express
mail.
</li>
</p>
<li>
The event requires two days of catering. Day 1 will host approximately
50 people. Day 2 will host those 50 individuals and 350 potential
clients for a total of 400 meals. Catering includes a continental
breakfast, box lunches, non-alcoholic hot and cold beverages, and light
snacks throughout the day. A comprehensive catering plan was developed
and approved.
</li>
</p>
<li>
The hotel will handle conference area setup and shutdown. Juan needs to
guide the hotel staff. There will be charges for these services.
</li>
</p>
<li>
The company provides funding. Juan will be required to provide finance
with an itemized list of costs at the end of the event for invoicing. An
initial budget for the project was developed and approved. This overview
includes financial estimates.
</li>
</p>
<li>
The team must coordinate all speakers, manage the agenda, address
developing issues, and ensure the program runs smoothly. An external
motivational speaker is required.
</li>
</p>
<li>
The event requires extensive audiovisual (AV) and Information Management
IT support. The internal teams can provide support; however, the event
might require additional outsourced support. Success Inc.'s IT
Department is evaluating requirements.
</li>
</p>
<li>
Sandra requested weekly status reports and a twice-weekly status meeting
and established a Change Control Board consisting of herself and all
Success Inc. Department leads.
</li>
</p>
</ul>
<h2 id="lets-meet-the-team">Let's Meet the Team</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Juan Cortez</b> is an experienced project manager who has been with
the firm for more than five years. He is highly skilled, motivated, and
self-directed. Juan was assigned as project manager only two weeks ago.
The prior project manager left the company for a new position. He is
working 20 hours a week on this project.
</li>
</p>
<li>
<b>Ramesh Patel</b> is new to the firm. He has limited project
management experience but is highly motivated to learn. Ramesh will help
implement the catering plan. He will be required to spend 30 hours on
this project. He spent 10 hours developing the Catering Plan. He will be
required for another 20 hours to implement the plan.
</li>
</p>
<li>
<b>Sophia Lamar</b> is a technical subject matter expert (SME). She does
have extensive experience in AV and IT management. However, this event
is her first investment event, and Sophia is not 100% comfortable with
the standard management process. She is both responsible and accountable
for IT and AV planning and execution. Sophia estimates about 25 hours to
accomplish her responsibilities. She has already devoted about 5 hours
to logistics planning and needs to keep her remaining hours available to
set up the venue and support the two-day workshop.
</li>
</p>
<li>
<b>Sarah Kim</b> is the hotel liaison. This event will be her fourth
investment event. Sarah will manage the setup and shutdown, financial
auditing for the event, and any ongoing issues. Sarah is highly
experienced and requires minimal direction. Sarah is a primary Core Team
member, and team members must inform her of all project statuses. Sarah
is also working 20 hours each week on the project.
</li>
</p>
<li>
<b>Priya Singh</b> is an Event Manager. Her job is to manage the
attendee list and ensure the agenda is updated and current. She is
responsible for the overall event program. She has solid skills. But she
asked Juan to provide her guidance as needed to ensure she is
successful. Priya will be needed for 10 hours each week.
</li>
</p>
<li>
<b>Michael Watson</b> is an intern. He joined the company three weeks
ago. Michael will assemble gift packets under the close watch of Priya.
Juan hopes to build his skills and confidence to support future events.
Michael will be required to devote 40 hours to this project. The team
will use Michael's time during the execution phase of the project.
</li>
</p>
<li>
<b>Valerie Shannon</b> is a senior-level operations manager at Success
Inc. She was previously assigned as Project Manager for similar events.
She is available to answer any technical or support questions Juan might
have. Valerie knows the ins and outs of the Success Inc. business model
and is motivated to assist if needed. She was integral in guiding the
project's initial planning. Valerie devoted two full days, or 16 hours
during the initial planning. She is likely to need about an hour each
week moving forward.
</li>
</p>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-project-to-date">The Project to Date</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The leaders approved the project plan on December 30. Project planning
began on December 1. It is currently January 31. The event will occur in
two months. The project has been relatively smooth. But there are some
issues. The total project duration is four months or 17 weeks in all.
</li>
</p>
<li>
Priya hoped to have replies for 70% of the invitations by now. Only 50%
are received. The Dallas area has been hit hard by the flu this year.
She is hoping that this is not a detractor. In addition, the current
economic conditions are unfavorable due to inflation and a tightening
job market.
</li>
</p>
<li>
Ramesh worked under Sarah's guidance to develop a catering plan and
finalize proposal reviews and vendor selection schedules. Sarah will
lead the source selection and finalize contracts for all external
support requirements. One vendor will satisfy the budget constraints
perfectly. However, this vendor does not have gluten-free offerings. A
second proposal will exceed the budget by ten percent. The good news is
that they can satisfy all dietary restrictions. The team informed
<b>Sandra Morgan</b> of the issue; her decision is pending.
</li>
</p>
<li>
Sophia is working with the Success Inc. IT team, who might be unable to
support some streaming requirements and need external support. The IT
lead promised to provide Sophia with an answer in one week.
</li>
</p>
<li>
The team accelerated their project planning, but some key planning
documents were incomplete. The project planning includes a team RACI, a
Communications Management Plan, and a Resource Breakdown Structure.
</li>
</p>
<li>
Sandra is finding it difficult to identify a motivational speaker who
satisfies the CEO's budget constraints and subject matter requirements,
which is an issue that the team must address before February 10.
