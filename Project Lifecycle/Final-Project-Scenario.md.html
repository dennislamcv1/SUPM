Final Project Scenario
</h1>
<h4>
Estimated duration: 4 minutes
</h4>
<h2 id="scenario-outdoor-recreation-inc.-ori">Scenario: Outdoor
Recreation Inc. (ORI)</h2>
<p>Outdoor Recreation Inc. (ORI) is a high-end producer and retailer of
outdoor recreational supplies. They produce a variety of products to
include camping supplies, outdoor bikes, clothing, and more. ORI is
located in the west coast of the United States and have retail outlets
in a five-state area. In all they have over 60 stores. The CEO is a firm
believer in giving back to the community as often as possible when they
can. The majority of employees are located in their headquarters
location.</p>
<p>ORI recently hired ten new employees to supplement their team where
they are headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The CEO wants to find a
way to integrate these new employees into the team in a way that is
productive for both the company and community.</p>
<p>An event was recently proposed by a group of ORI managers. The CEO
requested that an interim risk analysis be performed before the business
case is approved and project charter work begins. And you are that
team!</p>
<p>Magic mountain is located approximately 35 miles away from ORI
Headquarters. The project proposes that 30 employees from ORI travel to
Magic Mountain on Saturday, May 25th to participate in Magic Mountain
clean-up day. Of the thirty employees, 20 will be longer term employees
from headquarters and nearby retail outlets, and ten will be the new
hires. The weather in May is normally compatible for this project. A
normal high of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or approximately 15 degrees
Celsius can be expected. Rain chances are less than 20% this time of
year.</p>
<p>Two charter busses will be contracted to transport the employees to
and from Magic Mountain. The busses will depart at 7:30 AM and return by
4:30 PM. Unfortunately, only ORI employees are welcome to participate.
ORI family members who wish to attend must make their own
accommodations.</p>
<p>The ORI team will be split into two groups. One group of 15 will hike
along a five-mile walking path and pick up trash as a public service
along the way. The trail begins at the bottom of the mountain which is
1000-meters above sea level. The end of the trail is at the 2500-meter
level mark. Two people are able to walk abreast on the trail. The trail
is scenic, surrounded by trees and foliage, and hardened soil.</p>
<p>The second group will staff two tents. One tent will provide free
beverages, coffee, and pastries, and snacks compliments of ORI for that
day’s Magic Mountain visitors. The second tent will provide a point of
sales location on the mountain to purchase hiking equipment, clothing,
and other pertinent items to prospective customers. Magic Mountain has
authorized ORI to set up these two tents.</p>
<p>ORI plans to provide box lunches to all members of the team who
participate. In addition, ORI will be responsible for providing all
necessary supplies to conduct the trail clean up. The CEO has stated he
is willing to fund this project if it is approved without reservations.
Magic Mountain required all ORI employees attending to sign a waiver
stating ORI was not responsible for all risks and potential
injuries.</p>
